# 2015 OECD PISA - Understanding Student's Scores and Study Time
A ISSS616 Applied Statistical Analysis with R Project
AY2019-20 Term 1

## About

This is a project as part of the SMU **ISSS616 Applied Statistical Analysis with R** course, which involves the application of statistical concepts using R as the tool. Part of the requirement of this project was to examine a dataset of our choice, and to present our findings from the chosen dataset using a Shiny dashboard.

## The Topic

Singapore is well known for its quality education compared to other countries. In the triennial 2015 OECD Programme for the International Student Assessment (PISA), Singapore students topped the rankings as compared to the rest of the world. However, a survey by PISA also revealed that Singapore students tend to suffer from high levels of anxiety and have among one of the highest out-of-school study time.

In this project and this dashboard you are viewing right now, we want to find out whether the time spent studying has, in any way, contribute to their performance in PISA, especially that of Science. We are also interested in the factors contributing to out-of-school study time and performance of Singaporean students.

## Datasets

The datasets can be obtained from the [OECD PISA website](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2015database/).

The dataset pertains to the 2015 cycle of the OECD PISA, which was administed to 15 to 16-year-old students around the world. The assessment tests student's learning outcomes in Reading, Math and Science.
